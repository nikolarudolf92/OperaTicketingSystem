# SystemForReservationTicketsForOpera

In this project I made an app that allows people to reserve Operas.
When starting the application, the User should log in if he has an account and if he does not, then he must register.

The application offers the user 3 options:

1. Reservation of tickets for one of the operas, where he can choose the date and position for the selected opera.
2. Review of all reservations where the user can see all his reservations made and also cancel them.
3. Scheduling a new Opera, choosing Opera from the database, choosing a group, date and time. This ability to schedule a new Opera can not be seen by the user but only by the admin.
